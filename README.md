# rx-navigator

A reactive, typesafe navigation library for React and React Native

## Overview

@rx-navigator is a navigation library for React and React Native. The library focuses on type safety and improving
developer experience by separating the definitions into three main categories: the routes, the screens and the
navigators. _The routes_ specify the tree structure of the application as well as the parameters of each route. _The
screens_ are the actual pages of the application where the ui and the behaviour of each page is specified. Lastly, _the
navigators_ are mappings between _routes_ and _screens_ which tell the application how to navigate between routes.
